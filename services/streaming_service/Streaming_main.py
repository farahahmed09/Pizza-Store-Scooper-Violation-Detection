Description:
FastAPI-based web service for:
1. Serving the frontend UI.
2. Streaming real-time detection results via WebSocket (from RabbitMQ).
3. Exposing REST APIs to retrieve violation records and serve saved images.
Acts as the interface layer between the backend detection system and the frontend.
